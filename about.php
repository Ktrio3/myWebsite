          <p>
            In the summer of 2017, Kevin worked as an intern in the Cyber Security and
            Internet R&amp;D Department at LGS Innovations in Florham Park, NJ. His time there
            was spent researching the security of Industrial Control Systems and developing
            demonstrations of different varieties of exploits. Kevin has also worked for the
            University of South Florida as a Student Web Application Developer since 2016,
            where he played a major role in the development of several major academic applications.
            These include an integrated course proposal system and interactive student orientation checklist
            for international and underrepresented students.
          </p>

            Kevin has also been active in several student organizations on campus.
            Most notably, he has been in the Whitehatters Computer Security Club (WCSC)
            since the summer of 2016. WCSC students work together to solve CTF challenges
            and increase their understanding of cyber security, with the ultimate goal of competing at DEFCON.
            From the fall 2015 to spring 2016 semester, Kevin served as a Volunteer Co-Chair
            of the Honors College Student Council (HCSC), where he helped organized fundraising and
            volunteer events. Through their efforts, HCSC was able to raise over $1500 for Relay
            for Life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kevin's current interests are Industrial Control Systems security,
            and how these systems are exploited.
